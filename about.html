          Michael T. DeBoer &#038; Associates has been in business since 1984.</p>
          <p>Michael decided to follow in the footsteps of his father Dennis who has been in business since 1962. Dennis was known as &#8220;Mr. Mutual of Omaha&#8221; as he was consistently a top 10 insurance agent in the country for decades. He is also known as the agent in the Mutual of Omaha television commercials for the NBC program Wild Kingdom back in the 1980s.</p>
          <p class="lead">&#8220;When I was very young I saw first hand how my dad helped families that could have been devastated financially due to death or disability. He took care of his clients and they love him. I still use his same philosophies today. Do not sell products. Listen to your clients, put the facts together and share an idea. My father was never about the commissions. It was about doing the right thing for your client.  I guess you can say that insurance is in the family blood.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Michael is the father of Megan and her husband Trent, Matthew and his wife Rose, and Mitchell and his wife Megan. He is the proud grandfather of Wyatt and Gabriel.</p>
          <p>Since 1984, Michael has been servicing clients in the Chicagoland area. He is past president of the Elgin Area Insurance and Financial Advisor Association. Michael attended St. Edward H.S. in Elgin and Elgin Community College.</p>
