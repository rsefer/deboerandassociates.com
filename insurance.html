					<h2>Disability</h2>
					<p class="lead">1 in 6 people suffer a disability.</p>
					<p>How would you pay bills and put food on the table without your income? Your most important asset <i>is</i> your income. When a person becomes disabled, their regular financial obligations persist while their stream of income does not. Prepare yourself and your family in the event that an accident does occur.</p>

					<h2>Long-Term Care</h2>
					<p>Have you thought about the consequences a long term care event could have? If they aren&#8217;t protected, how would that affect their retirement plans and families? About 12.8 million Americans of all ages require long term care, but only 2.4 million live in nursing homes. Most long term care policies are designed to cover care in a wide range of settings. </p>
