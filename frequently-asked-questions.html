            <h3 id="grandfathered-vs-non-grandfathered-plans" class="faq-question">Grandfathered vs. Non-Grandfathered Plans</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>ACA was signed into law March 23rd, 2010. If a health plan was written prior to this date and makes no material changes to their plan, they can remain grandfathered and not have to abide by all provisions of the health care law. If the plan was written after that date or makes a material change, they are non-grandfathered and will be subject to ALL provisions of ACA.</p>
              <p>What is a material change?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Decrease in benefits of more than 15%: This would mean a deductible of $1000 could not be raised to more than $1150. A $20 copay could not be raised to more than $23. Since most carriers to not offer these options (usually offering a jump from $1000 to $1500, $20 to $30, etc.) in reality, almost any plan change where benefits are decreased results in a loss of grandfathered status.</li>
                <li>Increase in employee&#8217;s premium contribution by more than 5% per year: If the employer increases the employee&#8217;s contribution of premium by more than 5% over last year&#8217;s contribution, they lose their grandfather status. This includes employees and dependents.</li>

              <p>Previously companies used to be able to put a cap on the most they would pay on one person&#8217;s claims in a lifetime. Usually that amount ran around $5 million on most policies. That was removed on all plans, group and individual, grandfathered and non-grandfathered.</p>

Rebates are made to clients in the proportion of premium they paid in total.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The SBC is like a &#8220;nutrition label&#8221; for health insurance plans to make it easier for consumer to understand how their plan works. The law requires that all group and individual health plans distribute a SBC to members prior to enrollment, at renewal or when the group makes an off-renewal plan change. At renewal, the members must be given their SBC 10 days prior to their renewal.</p>
              <p>In the group market, if the group makes a plan change off renewal within the same carrier, the group must provide the new SBC to the employees 60 days prior to the plan change. This is only required when making an off renewal plan change and does not apply when switching carriers. To comply with this rule, Humana is requesting all paperwork for off renewal plans changes 70 days in advance on the effective date with an attestation form confirming the SBC was distributed to the employees. BCBS has yet to define their policy.</p>
              <p>In the individual market, the carriers will send the SBC direct to the consumer. In the group market, the carriers will send the SBC to the employer and the employer will have to distribute to the employees.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Requires employers with over 50 Full Time equivalent employees to provide &#8220;essential minimum coverage&#8221; to all full time employees (30 hours or more a week).</p>
              <p>If an employer chooses not to offer coverage, they will face a fine of $2,000 for every full-time employee not counting the first 30. (For ie., if an employer have 70 full time employees, the fine would be (70-30) 2 $2,000) = $80,000.</p>
              <p>Groups with under 50 FTE have will have no financial penalty if they do not provide coverage.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>To determine how many full time employees a group have, the group must consider part time employees into the equation. Add the total number of hours worked by the part time employees in a month, divide by 120, and that will give you how many Full Time Equivalents the part time employees comprise. For example, if your part time employees worked an average of 35 employees that in total worked 3000 hours in a month, you would divide that by 120 to get 25 Full Time Equivalents. You would then add the 25 FTE to the number of full time employees you have to get your total FTE. If that number is over 50, the group is subject to the penalty.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>A subsidy will be available to help purchase insure to those individuals and families making less than 400% federal poverty level. This subsidy can only be claimed by purchasing insurance through the exchange. The subsidy would prevent premium from exceeding the following percentages of annual household income. Subsidy is based off premium for the silver plan.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>100%-133% FPL: 2% of income</li>
                <li>133%-150% FPL: 3%-4% of income</li>
                <li>150%-200% FPL: 4%-6.3% of income</li>
                <li>200%-250% FPL: 6.3%-8.05% of income</li>
                <li>250%-300% FPL: 8.05%-9.5% of income</li>
                <li>300%-400% FPL: 9.5% of income</li>
                <li>Adjust for inflation in future years</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each state is responsible for setting up their own exchange website. If they wish not to set up their own, they can use the federal version of the exchange. Illinois has chosen to pursue a partnership exchange, where they use the federal exchange for the first year, transitioning into a state run exchange in year two.</p>
              <p>The exchanges will be linked to the IRS to gather tax information to determined an individual&#8217;s eligibility for the subsidy. The insurance companies will get paid the subsidy amount from the Department of Treasury.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Plans will be tiered based on the Actuarial Value (AV) of the plan. They are classified by &#8220;metal&#8221; names. Actuarial Value is calculated as the percent of total average cost for covered benefits that a plan will cover. For example, if a plan has an AV of 70%, on average, a consumer would be responsible for 30% of covered benefits by way of deducible, coinsurance and copays. This is NOT the same as coinsurance. It is created so consumers can compare plans with similar benefits, even if deductible, coinsurance, and copay amounts are different.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bronze Plan: AV of 60%</li>
                <li>Silver Plan: AV of 70%</li>

              <p>As part of the ACA law, or Health Care reform, Small Businesses may be eligible for a tax credit of up to 35% from 2010-2013, and increasing to 50% in 2014 if certain criteria are met.

              <p>There are currently phase outs for those employees making between $25,000 and $50,000 at a business with 10-25 employees. Those companies will not qualify for the entire 35%, and may not be eligible at all.</p>
